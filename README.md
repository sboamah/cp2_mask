## HAR371: Creative Programming 2
### by Sylvia Boamah

#### Technologies used: [p5js](https://p5js.org/), [TensorFlow (Blazeface)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/blazeface) 

The goal of this project was to create a mask that visualizes at least **three** words that describe intimate parts of my life.

The three words that I initially focused on were:
* Ghanaian
* Sheltered
* Fantasize 

From there, I wanted to create a visual that explores the tension between tradition and identity that may be shunned by one's culture. Envisioning a harmony between the two can seem like a fantasy, so I wanted to show that in some way.

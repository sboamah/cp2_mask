# Mask Project (Facial Detection)
## HAR371: Creative Programming 2
### by Sylvia Boamah

The goal of this project was to create a mask that visualizes at least **three** words that describe intimate parts of my life.

The three words that I initially focused on were:
* Ghanaian
* Sheltered
* Fantasize 

From there, I wanted to create a visual that explores the tension between tradition and identity that may be shunned by one's culture.
